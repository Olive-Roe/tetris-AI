Piece notation (str)
Notation to describe a piece
Pieces are described with the position of their bottom-left corner
(Bottom-most tile, then left-most tile)
Type of piece, orientation, x-coordinate (column), y-coordinate (row)
(column and row start from index 0)
Y-coordinate can be between 0 and 39
X-coordinate can be between 0 and 9
"S024"

Board notation (str)
Condensed description of a board
Starts with an asterisk (*)
Letters to represent pieces
Numbers to represent empty spaces
Rows are in between slashes (/)
Empty rows are represented with /, like "J9//9L"
There can be extra rows at the start
(Can take up to 40 rows)
Represents garbage rows with "gN", where N is the column that is empty
e.g. "g2" = "xx.xxxxxxx" (starts with a zero-index)
"*JJJI3ZZT/OOJI2ZZTT/OOLI3SST/LLLI4SS//J9"

Extended board notation (str)
Extended description of a board
Starts with an asterisk
Replaces numbers with (.) for empty spaces so that each row is 10 characters long
Used for formatting/displaying/updating purposes
Is 40 rows long, and fills empty rows at the end if necessary
Replaces garbage rows ('g6') with 'xxxxxx.xxxx', for example
"*xxxxxx.xxxx/LIOZ....IL/JS.....TSZ/SZSZ....../O........./J........./........../........../........../........../........../........../........../........../........../........../........../........../........../.........."

Piece-board notation (str)
Consists of piece notation and (shortened) board notation separated by a colon
Used for describing the state of the board and the piece
"I253:*LIOZ4IL/JS5TSZ/SZSZ6/O9/J9"

Bag (str)
Consists of 13/14 pieces represented by letters
Used for showing the next queue
"OLIZTSJSLZTJOI"

Action notation (str)
Consists of different codes for different actions:
CW/CCW/180 -> rotates current piece
l/r -> moves current piece left/right
L/R -> moves current piece as much left/right as possible
d -> moves current piece down as much as possible
hd -> d + lock
d(n) -> moves current piece by n tiles
lock -> locks current piece
hold -> holds current piece
g0x5 -> receives 5 rows of garbage in column 0
separated by a space, and then (time) -> time since start
